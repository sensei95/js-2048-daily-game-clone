## How to play

Combine tiles of the same number in an attempt to create a tile with the value 2048.

Pressing the arrow keys across the game board will move all tiles in the direction of the key pressed. After all the tiles are done moving a new tile with the value of 2 or 4 will be created in a random empty cell.

Two tiles with the same number will merge when they collide to create a single tile with double the value.

The game is over when there are no valid ways for you to move the tiles.
